> **TOON Format Default**
> - Encode structured artifacts with `encodeTOON` or `scripts/toon-wrapper.sh encode` into `.toon` files.
> - Load artifacts with `autoDecode`/`decodeTOON` (or `scripts/toon-wrapper.sh decode`) to auto-detect TOON vs legacy `.json`.
> - When instructions mention JSON outputs, treat TOON as the default format while keeping legacy `.json` readable.


## 🏗️ **System Architect Analysis Generator**

### Purpose
**Specialized command for generating system-architect/analysis.md** that addresses guidance-specification.md discussion points from system architecture perspective. Creates or updates role-specific analysis with framework references.

### Core Function
- **Framework-based Analysis**: Address each discussion point in guidance-specification.md
- **Architecture Focus**: Technical architecture, scalability, and system design perspective
- **Update Mechanism**: Create new or update existing analysis.md
- **Agent Delegation**: Use conceptual-planning-agent for analysis generation

### Analysis Scope
- **Technical Architecture**: Scalable and maintainable system design
- **Technology Selection**: Stack evaluation and architectural decisions
- **Performance & Scalability**: Capacity planning and optimization strategies
- **Integration Patterns**: System communication and data flow design

### Role Boundaries & Responsibilities

#### **What This Role OWNS (Macro-Architecture)**
- **System-Level Architecture**: Service boundaries, deployment topology, and system composition
- **Cross-Service Communication Patterns**: Choosing between microservices/monolithic, event-driven/request-response, sync/async patterns
- **Technology Stack Decisions**: Language, framework, database, and infrastructure choices
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Scalability, performance, availability, disaster recovery, and monitoring strategies
- **Integration Planning**: How systems and services connect at the macro level (not specific API contracts)

#### **What This Role DOES NOT Own (Defers to Other Roles)**
- **API Contract Details**: Specific endpoint definitions, URL structures, HTTP methods → Defers to **API Designer**
- **Data Schemas**: Detailed data model design and entity relationships → Defers to **Data Architect**
- **UI/UX Design**: Interface design and user experience → Defers to **UX Expert** and **UI Designer**

#### **Handoff Points**
- **TO API Designer**: Provides architectural constraints (REST vs GraphQL, sync vs async) that define the API design space
- **TO Data Architect**: Provides system-level data flow requirements and integration patterns
- **FROM Data Architect**: Receives canonical data model to inform system integration design

## ⚙️ **Execution Protocol**

### Phase 1: Session & Framework Detection
```bash
# Check active session and framework
CHECK: .workflow/.active-* marker files
IF active_session EXISTS:
    session_id = get_active_session()
    brainstorm_dir = .workflow/WFS-{session}/.brainstorming/

    CHECK: brainstorm_dir/guidance-specification.md
    IF EXISTS:
        framework_mode = true
        load_framework = true
    ELSE:
        IF topic_provided:
            framework_mode = false  # Create analysis without framework
        ELSE:
            ERROR: "No framework found and no topic provided"
```

### Phase 2: Analysis Mode Detection
```bash
# Check existing analysis
CHECK: brainstorm_dir/system-architect/analysis.md
IF EXISTS:
    SHOW existing analysis summary
    ASK: "Analysis exists. Do you want to:"
    OPTIONS:
      1. "Update with new insights" → Update existing
      2. "Replace completely" → Generate new
      3. "Cancel" → Exit without changes
ELSE:
    CREATE new analysis
```

### Phase 3: Agent Task Generation

- **Role Focus**: System Architecture and Technical Design perspective
- **5 Framework Sections**: Address each framework discussion point
- **Technical Recommendations**: Architecture-specific insights and solutions

## ⚡ **Two-Step Execution Flow**

### ⚠️ Session Management - FIRST STEP
Session detection and selection:
```bash
# Check for active sessions
active_sessions=$(find .workflow -name ".active-*" 2>/dev/null)
if [ multiple_sessions ]; then
  prompt_user_to_select_session()
else
  use_existing_or_create_new()
fi
```

### Step 1: Context Gathering Phase
**System Architect Perspective Questioning**

Before agent assignment, gather comprehensive system architecture context:

#### 📋 Role-Specific Questions
1. **Scale & Performance Requirements**
   - Expected user load and traffic patterns?
   - Performance requirements (latency, throughput)?
   - Data volume and growth projections?

2. **Technical Constraints & Environment**
   - Existing technology stack and constraints?
   - Integration requirements with external systems?
   - Infrastructure and deployment environment?

3. **Architecture Complexity & Patterns**
   - Microservices vs monolithic considerations?
   - Data consistency and transaction requirements?
   - Event-driven vs request-response patterns?

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - High availability and disaster recovery needs?
   - Security and compliance requirements?
   - Monitoring and observability expectations?

#### Context Validation
- **Minimum Response**: Each answer must be ≥50 characters
- **Re-prompting**: Insufficient detail triggers follow-up questions
- **Context Storage**: Save responses to `.brainstorming/system-architect-context.md`

### Step 2: Agent Assignment with Flow Control
**Dedicated Agent Execution**

```bash
Task(conceptual-planning-agent): "
[FLOW_CONTROL]

Execute dedicated system-architect conceptual analysis for: {topic}

ASSIGNED_ROLE: system-architect
OUTPUT_LOCATION: .brainstorming/system-architect/
USER_CONTEXT: {validated_responses_from_context_gathering}

Flow Control Steps:
[
  {
    \"step\": \"load_role_template\",
    \"action\": \"Load system-architect planning template\",
    \"command\": \"bash($(cat ~/.claude/workflows/cli-templates/planning-roles/system-architect.md))\",
    \"output_to\": \"role_template\"
  }
]

Conceptual Analysis Requirements:
- Apply system-architect perspective to topic analysis
- Focus on architectural patterns, scalability, and integration points
- Use loaded role template framework for analysis structure
- Generate role-specific deliverables in designated output location
- Address all user context from questioning phase

Deliverables:
- analysis.md: Main system architecture analysis
- recommendations.md: Architecture recommendations
- deliverables/: Architecture-specific outputs as defined in role template

Embody system-architect role expertise for comprehensive conceptual planning."
