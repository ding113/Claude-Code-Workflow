# TDD Workflow Plan Command (/workflow:tdd-plan)

## Coordinator Role

**This command is a pure orchestrator**: Execute 6 slash commands in sequence, parse outputs, pass context, and ensure complete TDD workflow creation with Red-Green-Refactor task generation.

**Execution Modes**:
- **Agent Mode** (default): Use `/workflow:tools:task-generate-tdd` (autonomous agent-driven)
- **CLI Mode** (`--cli-execute`): Use `/workflow:tools:task-generate-tdd --cli-execute` (Gemini)

**Task Attachment Model**:
- SlashCommand invocation **expands workflow** by attaching sub-tasks to current TodoWrite
- When a sub-command is invoked (e.g., `/workflow:tools:test-context-gather`), its internal tasks are attached to the orchestrator's TodoWrite
- Orchestrator **executes these attached tasks** sequentially
- After completion, attached tasks are **collapsed** back to high-level phase summary
- This is **task expansion**, not external delegation

**Auto-Continue Mechanism**:
- TodoList tracks current phase status and dynamically manages task attachment/collapse
- When each phase finishes executing, automatically execute next pending phase
- All phases run autonomously without user interaction
- **⚠️ CONTINUOUS EXECUTION** - Do not stop until all phases complete

## Core Rules

1. **Start Immediately**: First action is TodoWrite initialization, second action is Phase 1 execution
2. **No Preliminary Analysis**: Do not read files before Phase 1
3. **Parse Every Output**: Extract required data for next phase
4. **Auto-Continue via TodoList**: Check TodoList status to execute next pending phase automatically
5. **Track Progress**: Update TodoWrite dynamically with task attachment/collapse pattern
6. **TDD Context**: All descriptions include "TDD:" prefix
7. **Task Attachment Model**: SlashCommand invocation **attaches** sub-tasks to current workflow. Orchestrator **executes** these attached tasks itself, then **collapses** them after completion
8. **⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT STOP**: Continuous multi-phase workflow. After executing all attached tasks, immediately collapse them and execute next phase

## 6-Phase Execution (with Conflict Resolution)

### Phase 1: Session Discovery
**Command**: `/workflow:session:start --auto "TDD: [structured-description]"`

**TDD Structured Format**:
```
TDD: [Feature Name]
GOAL: [Objective]
SCOPE: [Included/excluded]
CONTEXT: [Background]
TEST_FOCUS: [Test scenarios]
```

**Parse**: Extract sessionId

**TodoWrite**: Mark phase 1 completed, phase 2 in_progress

**After Phase 1**: Return to user showing Phase 1 results, then auto-continue to Phase 2

---

### Phase 2: Context Gathering
**Command**: `/workflow:tools:context-gather --session [sessionId] "TDD: [structured-description]"`

**Use Same Structured Description**: Pass the same structured format from Phase 1

**Input**: `sessionId` from Phase 1

**Parse Output**:
- Extract: context-package.json path (store as `contextPath`)
- Typical pattern: `.workflow/[sessionId]/.process/context-package.json`

**Validation**:
- Context package path extracted
- File exists and is valid JSON

**TodoWrite**: Mark phase 2 completed, phase 3 in_progress

**After Phase 2**: Return to user showing Phase 2 results, then auto-continue to Phase 3

---

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Analysis
**Command**: `/workflow:tools:test-context-gather --session [sessionId]`

**Purpose**: Analyze existing codebase for:
- Existing test patterns and conventions
- Current test coverage
- Related components and integration points
- Test framework detection

**Parse**: Extract testContextPath (`.workflow/[sessionId]/.process/test-context-package.json`)

**Benefits**:
- Makes TDD aware of existing environment
- Identifies reusable test patterns
- Prevents duplicate test creation
- Enables integration with existing tests

<!-- TodoWrite: When test-context-gather invoked, INSERT 3 test-context-gather tasks -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 3 SlashCommand invoked - tasks attached)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Execute session discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Execute context gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Phase 3.1: Detect test framework and conventions (test-context-gather)", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Detecting test framework"},
  {"content": "Phase 3.2: Analyze existing test coverage (test-context-gather)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing test coverage"},
  {"content": "Phase 3.3: Identify coverage gaps (test-context-gather)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Identifying coverage gaps"},
  {"content": "Execute TDD task generation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Validate TDD structure", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: SlashCommand invocation **attaches** test-context-gather's 3 tasks. Orchestrator **executes** these tasks.

**Next Action**: Tasks attached → **Execute Phase 3.1-3.3** sequentially

<!-- TodoWrite: After Phase 3 tasks complete, REMOVE Phase 3.1-3.3, restore to orchestrator view -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 3 completed - tasks collapsed)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Execute session discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Execute context gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Execute test coverage analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Execute TDD task generation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Validate TDD structure", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: Phase 3 tasks completed and collapsed to summary.

**After Phase 3**: Return to user showing test coverage results, then auto-continue to Phase 4/5 (depending on conflict_risk)

---

### Phase 4: Conflict Resolution (Optional - auto-triggered by conflict risk)

**Trigger**: Only execute when context-package.json indicates conflict_risk is "medium" or "high"

**Command**: `SlashCommand(command="/workflow:tools:conflict-resolution --session [sessionId] --context [contextPath]")`

**Input**:
- sessionId from Phase 1
- contextPath from Phase 2
- conflict_risk from context-package.json

**Parse Output**:
- Extract: Execution status (success/skipped/failed)
- Verify: CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md file path (if executed)

**Validation**:
- File `.workflow/[sessionId]/.process/CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` exists (if executed)

**Skip Behavior**:
- If conflict_risk is "none" or "low", skip directly to Phase 5
- Display: "No significant conflicts detected, proceeding to TDD task generation"

<!-- TodoWrite: If conflict_risk ≥ medium, INSERT 3 conflict-resolution tasks -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 4 SlashCommand invoked - tasks attached, if conflict_risk ≥ medium)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Execute session discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Execute context gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Execute test coverage analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Phase 4.1: Detect conflicts with CLI analysis (conflict-resolution)", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Detecting conflicts"},
  {"content": "Phase 4.2: Present conflicts to user (conflict-resolution)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Presenting conflicts"},
  {"content": "Phase 4.3: Apply resolution strategies (conflict-resolution)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Applying resolution strategies"},
  {"content": "Execute TDD task generation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Validate TDD structure", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: SlashCommand invocation **attaches** conflict-resolution's 3 tasks. Orchestrator **executes** these tasks.

**Next Action**: Tasks attached → **Execute Phase 4.1-4.3** sequentially

<!-- TodoWrite: After Phase 4 tasks complete, REMOVE Phase 4.1-4.3, restore to orchestrator view -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 4 completed - tasks collapsed)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Execute session discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Execute context gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Execute test coverage analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Execute conflict resolution", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing conflict resolution"},
  {"content": "Execute TDD task generation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Validate TDD structure", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: Phase 4 tasks completed and collapsed to summary.

**After Phase 4**: Return to user showing conflict resolution results (if executed) and selected strategies, then auto-continue to Phase 5

**Memory State Check**:
- Evaluate current context window usage and memory state
- If memory usage is high (>110K tokens or approaching context limits):
  - **Command**: `SlashCommand(command="/compact")`
  - This optimizes memory before proceeding to Phase 5
- Memory compaction is particularly important after analysis phase which may generate extensive documentation
- Ensures optimal performance and prevents context overflow

---

### Phase 5: TDD Task Generation
**Command**:
- Agent Mode (default): `/workflow:tools:task-generate-tdd --session [sessionId]`
- CLI Mode (`--cli-execute`): `/workflow:tools:task-generate-tdd --session [sessionId] --cli-execute`

**Parse**: Extract feature count, task count (not chain count - tasks now contain internal TDD cycles)

**Validate**:
- IMPL_PLAN.md exists (unified plan with TDD Implementation Tasks section)
- IMPL-*.json files exist (one per feature, or container + subtasks for complex features)
- TODO_LIST.md exists with internal TDD phase indicators
- Each IMPL task includes:
  - `meta.tdd_workflow: true`
  - `flow_control.implementation_approach` with 3 steps (red/green/refactor)
  - Green phase includes test-fix-cycle configuration
- IMPL_PLAN.md contains workflow_type: "tdd" in frontmatter
- Task count ≤10 (compliance with task limit)

<!-- TodoWrite: When task-generate-tdd invoked, INSERT 3 task-generate-tdd tasks -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 5 SlashCommand invoked - tasks attached)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Execute session discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Execute context gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Execute test coverage analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Phase 5.1: Discovery - analyze TDD requirements (task-generate-tdd)", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Analyzing TDD requirements"},
  {"content": "Phase 5.2: Planning - design Red-Green-Refactor cycles (task-generate-tdd)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Designing TDD cycles"},
  {"content": "Phase 5.3: Output - generate IMPL tasks with internal TDD phases (task-generate-tdd)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating TDD tasks"},
  {"content": "Validate TDD structure", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: SlashCommand invocation **attaches** task-generate-tdd's 3 tasks. Orchestrator **executes** these tasks. Each generated IMPL task will contain internal Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

**Next Action**: Tasks attached → **Execute Phase 5.1-5.3** sequentially

<!-- TodoWrite: After Phase 5 tasks complete, REMOVE Phase 5.1-5.3, restore to orchestrator view -->

**TodoWrite Update (Phase 5 completed - tasks collapsed)**:
```json
[
  {"content": "Execute session discovery", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing session discovery"},
  {"content": "Execute context gathering", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing context gathering"},
  {"content": "Execute test coverage analysis", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing test coverage analysis"},
  {"content": "Execute TDD task generation", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Executing TDD task generation"},
  {"content": "Validate TDD structure", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Validating TDD structure"}
]
```

**Note**: Phase 5 tasks completed and collapsed to summary. Each generated IMPL task contains complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle internally.

### Phase 6: TDD Structure Validation & Action Plan Verification (RECOMMENDED)
**Internal validation first, then recommend external verification**

**Internal Validation**:
1. Each task contains complete TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor internally)
2. Task structure validation:
   - `meta.tdd_workflow: true` in all IMPL tasks
   - `flow_control.implementation_approach` has exactly 3 steps
   - Each step has correct `tdd_phase`: "red", "green", "refactor"
3. Dependency validation:
   - Sequential features: IMPL-N depends_on ["IMPL-(N-1)"] if needed
   - Complex features: IMPL-N.M depends_on ["IMPL-N.(M-1)"] for subtasks
4. Agent assignment: All IMPL tasks use @code-developer
5. Test-fix cycle: Green phase step includes test-fix-cycle logic with max_iterations
6. Task count: Total tasks ≤10 (simple + subtasks)

**Return Summary**:
```
TDD Planning complete for session: [sessionId]

Features analyzed: [N]
Total tasks: [M] (1 task per simple feature + subtasks for complex features)

Task breakdown:
- Simple features: [K] tasks (IMPL-1 to IMPL-K)
- Complex features: [L] features with [P] subtasks
- Total task count: [M] (within 10-task limit)

Structure:
- IMPL-1: {Feature 1 Name} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
- IMPL-2: {Feature 2 Name} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
- IMPL-3: {Complex Feature} (Container)
  - IMPL-3.1: {Sub-feature A} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
  - IMPL-3.2: {Sub-feature B} (Internal: Red → Green → Refactor)
[...]

Plans generated:
- Unified Implementation Plan: .workflow/[sessionId]/IMPL_PLAN.md
  (includes TDD Implementation Tasks section with workflow_type: "tdd")
- Task List: .workflow/[sessionId]/TODO_LIST.md
  (with internal TDD phase indicators)

TDD Configuration:
- Each task contains complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Green phase includes test-fix cycle (max 3 iterations)
- Auto-revert on max iterations reached

Recommended Next Steps:
1. /workflow:action-plan-verify --session [sessionId]  # Verify TDD plan quality and dependencies
2. /workflow:execute --session [sessionId]  # Start TDD execution
3. /workflow:tdd-verify [sessionId]  # Post-execution TDD compliance check

Quality Gate: Consider running /workflow:action-plan-verify to validate TDD task structure and dependencies
```

## TodoWrite Pattern

**Core Concept**: Dynamic task attachment and collapse for TDD workflow with test coverage analysis and Red-Green-Refactor cycle generation.

### Key Principles

1. **Task Attachment** (when SlashCommand invoked):
   - Sub-command's internal tasks are **attached** to orchestrator's TodoWrite
   - Example: `/workflow:tools:test-context-gather` attaches 3 sub-tasks (Phase 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
   - First attached task marked as `in_progress`, others as `pending`
   - Orchestrator **executes** these attached tasks sequentially

2. **Task Collapse** (after sub-tasks complete):
   - Remove detailed sub-tasks from TodoWrite
   - **Collapse** to high-level phase summary
   - Example: Phase 3.1-3.3 collapse to "Execute test coverage analysis: completed"
   - Maintains clean orchestrator-level view

3. **Continuous Execution**:
   - After collapse, automatically proceed to next pending phase
   - No user intervention required between phases
   - TodoWrite dynamically reflects current execution state

**Lifecycle Summary**: Initial pending tasks → Phase invoked (tasks ATTACHED) → Sub-tasks executed sequentially → Phase completed (tasks COLLAPSED to summary) → Next phase begins (conditional Phase 4 if conflict_risk ≥ medium) → Repeat until all phases complete.

### TDD-Specific Features

- **Phase 3**: Test coverage analysis detects existing patterns and gaps
- **Phase 5**: Generated IMPL tasks contain internal Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **Conditional Phase 4**: Conflict resolution only if conflict_risk ≥ medium

### Benefits

- ✓ Real-time visibility into TDD workflow execution
- ✓ Clear mental model: SlashCommand = attach → execute → collapse
- ✓ Test-aware planning with coverage analysis
- ✓ Self-contained TDD cycles within each IMPL task

**Note**: See individual Phase descriptions (Phase 3, 4, 5) for detailed TodoWrite Update examples with full JSON structures.

• TDD-specific: Each generated IMPL task contains complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle
```

## Input Processing

Convert user input to TDD-structured format:

**Simple text** → Add TDD context
**Detailed text** → Extract components with TEST_FOCUS
**File/Issue** → Read and structure with TDD

## Error Handling

- **Parsing failure**: Retry once, then report
- **Validation failure**: Report missing/invalid data
- **Command failure**: Keep phase in_progress, report error
- **TDD validation failure**: Report incomplete chains or wrong dependencies

## TDD Workflow Enhancements

### Overview
The TDD workflow has been significantly enhanced by integrating best practices from both traditional `plan --agent` and `test-gen` workflows, creating a hybrid approach that bridges the gap between idealized TDD and real-world development complexity.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Test Coverage Analysis (Phase 3)
**Adopted from test-gen workflow**

Before planning TDD tasks, the workflow now analyzes the existing codebase:
- Detects existing test patterns and conventions
- Identifies current test coverage
- Discovers related components and integration points
- Detects test framework automatically

**Benefits**:
- Context-aware TDD planning
- Avoids duplicate test creation
- Enables integration with existing tests
- No longer assumes greenfield scenarios

#### 2. Iterative Green Phase with Test-Fix Cycle
**Adopted from test-gen workflow**

IMPL (Green phase) tasks now include automatic test-fix cycle for resilient implementation:

**Enhanced IMPL Task Flow**:
```
1. Write minimal implementation code
2. Execute test suite
3. IF tests pass → Complete task
4. IF tests fail → Enter fix cycle:
   a. Gemini diagnoses with bug-fix template
   b. Apply fix (manual or Codex)
   c. Retest
   d. Repeat (max 3 iterations)
5. IF max iterations → Auto-revert changes 🔄
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster feedback within Green phase
- Autonomous recovery from implementation errors
- Systematic debugging with Gemini
- Safe rollback prevents broken state

#### 3. Agent-Driven Planning
**From plan --agent workflow**

Supports action-planning-agent for more autonomous TDD planning with:
- MCP tool integration (code-index, exa)
- Memory-first principles
- Brainstorming artifact integration
- Task merging over decomposition

### Workflow Comparison

| Aspect | Previous | Current (Optimized) |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Phases** | 6 (with test coverage) | 7 (added concept verification) |
| **Context** | Greenfield assumption | Existing codebase aware |
| **Task Structure** | 1 feature = 3 tasks (TEST/IMPL/REFACTOR) | 1 feature = 1 task (internal TDD cycle) |
| **Task Count** | 5 features = 15 tasks | 5 features = 5 tasks (70% reduction) |
| **Green Phase** | Single implementation | Iterative with fix cycle |
| **Failure Handling** | Manual intervention | Auto-diagnose + fix + revert |
| **Test Analysis** | None | Deep coverage analysis |
| **Feedback Loop** | Post-execution | During Green phase |
| **Task Management** | High overhead (15 tasks) | Low overhead (5 tasks) |
| **Execution Efficiency** | Frequent context switching | Continuous context per feature |

### Migration Notes

**Backward Compatibility**: Fully compatible
- Existing TDD workflows continue to work
- New features are additive, not breaking
- Phase 3 can be skipped if test-context-gather not available

**Session Structure**:
